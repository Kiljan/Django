# DjangoBlogTutorial
From Django Girls tutorial

Complite simple blog with Django
Admin == admin
Pasword == wężykP

I dont like a database management here. Different statments compared to what I used in plain sql query.
For now I look a diffrent solution. More Java like (for example PreparedStatement() class)

1. Download all files to one folder
2. run virtual enviroment --> . DjangoBlogTutorial/myenv_two/VirtualBox VMs/bin/activate
3. run django server (must be in project folder with manage.py file) --> python manage.py runserver
4. in web browser go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or localhost:8000; it's the same)
5. end work with Ctrl+z; for stoping the server
6. deactivate vm with command --> deactivate
